In the unlikely event that our user care team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if Kalamos Care has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</Typography>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</li>\n                                <li>claims that arose before this or any prior agreements (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</li>\n                                <li>claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and</li>\n                                <li>claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms of Use.</li>\n                            </ul>\n                            <Typography variant=\"body1\" paragraph={true}>References to ‘Kalamos Care’, ‘you’, and ‘us’ include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and Kalamos Care are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. &nbsp;These Terms of Use evidence a transaction in the interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Use.</Typography>\n                            <Typography variant=\"body1\" paragraph={true}>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (‘Notice’). &nbsp;The Notice to Kalamos Care should be addressed to Kalamos Care, Inc. at [__________] (‘Arbitration Notice Address’). &nbsp;The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (‘Demand’). &nbsp;If Kalamos Care and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Kalamos Care may commence an arbitration proceeding. &nbsp;During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Kalamos Care or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Kalamos Care is entitled.</Typography>\n                            <Typography variant=\"body1\" paragraph={true}>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, ‘AAA Rules’) of the American Arbitration Association (‘AAA’), as modified by these Terms of Use, and will be administered by the AAA. &nbsp;The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Arbitration Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of the arbitration provision. Unless Kalamos Care and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. &nbsp;If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. &nbsp;Kalamos Care will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the AAA Rules. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</Typography>\n                            <Typography variant=\"body1\" paragraph={true}>The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees and expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</Typography>\n                            <Typography variant=\"body1\" paragraph={true}>The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. YOU AND KALAMOS CARE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. &nbsp;Further, unless both you and Kalamos Care agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</Typography>\n                            <Typography variant=\"body1\" paragraph={true}>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Kalamos Care makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Arbitration Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. &nbsp;By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</Typography>\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            <b>Governing Law</b>\n                            <Typography variant=\"body1\" paragraph={true}>Any claim relating to the Services, or your interactions with us through the Services, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any of its provisions that would cause the laws of another jurisdiction to apply. &nbsp;You and Kalamos Care agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within New York County, New York. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF USE. FURTHER, EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF EITHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL PROVISION. &nbsp;Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
