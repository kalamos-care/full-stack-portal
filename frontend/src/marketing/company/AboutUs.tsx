            Sexual health is awkward. It doesn't have to be.
        </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            It can be awkward to talk to someone you don't know about sex. Hell,
            it can be hard to talk to someone you do know about sex. And it's even
            harder when you're concerned something might be wrong.
        </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            As a result, sexual healthcare is too often reactionary and
            fear-based. Kalamos is all about turning that on its head.

            We know there's a better way. We know that patients are capable of
            being active participants in their care. We know by creating
            convenient services, we enable more people to get the care they need.

            That burning sensation to solve a problem
        </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            I still remember my first time getting tested, or rather the roller
            coaster of emotions before and after.
        </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            I woke up and it burned to pee, like badly. Half-convinced this was
            the end, I reached out to an older friend for advice. He calmed me
            down and took me to the clinic in the Castro. Yes, even in the heart
            of SF, I was still woefully under-educated about sexual health and
            afraid to go to the clinic alone.
        </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Everyone at the clinic was kind, reassuring, and cheerful. Where I
            grew up, you didn't really talk about these things. 30 minutes later,
            the doctor had taken my samples, treated me proactively, and reassured
            me that everything was going to be just fine. "Come back in a week to
            check in," he said with a smile, handing me a heap of condoms.
        </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            What I really got out of the experience was knowledge, security, and
            confidence. The dissolution of stigma around sexual health and the
            reassurance that I would be okay was incredibly powerful.
        </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            That experience stuck with me because of how lucky I was, and thatâ€™s
            ultimately why I created Kalamos. Everyone deserved affirmative access
            to sexual wellness.
